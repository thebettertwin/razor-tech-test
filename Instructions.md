Overview
Develop a web application that allows users to search for movies, view their details and leave reviews. The application should allow users to:

Search for movies by title
View a list of paginated search results with movie titles, directors, and actors
Click on a movie to view its details, including the title, director, actors, release date, runtime, and a brief summary
Add and view movie reviews on movie details page (itâ€™s fine for these to be persisted in the browser)
Navigate back to the paginated search results from the movie details page
Technical Requirements:
Use the latest version of Vue.js or React with TypeScript for the web application
Use the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to search for and retrieve movie data (http://www.omdbapi.com/)
Use mobile-first responsive design
Additional information:
The application should be submitted as a git repository with a clear README.md file explaining how to run the application locally
Create a NOTES.md for:
Creating a plan of attack - task out what you plan to do and estimate each task on how long you think it will take.
Describing any decisions made or workarounds
Explain your component structure, state management approach, and any patterns you've used
How would you extend this app with new features like user authentication or favorite movies?
What are we looking for?
Clean, readable, maintainable and testable code
How have you structured your components, hooks, and services? Would your approach scale to a larger application?
How do you handle application state, loading states, and data flow between components?
Have you thought about different platforms/devices?
Have you thought about security?
Have you thought about performance?
Good luck and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
